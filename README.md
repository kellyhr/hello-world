first attempt 
Hey! I'm Kelly and just trying to make sense of this right now. 
This looks weirdly fun
Also I'm an Entertainment Masters student from Beirut, but French intially with Lebanese-Armenian origins, who grew up in Swizterland - so what/who am I really? Can't tell. But I do speak 3 languages so that's cool (and I guess soon a 4th one with this class)
